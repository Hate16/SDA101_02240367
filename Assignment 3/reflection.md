# Reflection on Landing Page Code

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
1. *Semantic HTML*: Using tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> enhances readability and accessibility, helping search engines and screen readers understand the content.
2. *Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS*: Tailwind's utility classes, such as grid and md:grid-cols-2, make the page adaptable to different devices, supporting a mobile-first design.
3. *User-Centered Layout*: Each section is designed for engagement, featuring clear navigation and call-to-action buttons that encourage user interaction.
4. *Grid System*: The grid layout organizes content effectively, making it easy to update and maintain a consistent design.
5. *Form Integration*: A simple reservation form lays the groundwork for future development, like backend integration and validation.

### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
1. *Utility-First CSS Framework (Tailwind)*: I learned to use Tailwind CSS for creating responsive layouts quickly without custom CSS, simplifying style management.
2. *Grid Layouts*: I improved my skills in grid design, using Tailwind’s utilities to build responsive layouts efficiently.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
I discovered the effectiveness of Tailwind CSS in creating responsive layouts quickly. Its utility-first approach promotes flexibility and consistency, which was especially useful for applying styles throughout the design. I also reinforced my understanding of mobile-first design, using Tailwind’s built-in media queries to adapt layouts for various screens.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. *Alignment Issues*: Ensuring proper vertical alignment of images and text in two-column layouts was a challenge. I adjusted padding and used items-center to fix this.

2. *Placeholder Images*: Using placeholder images made the layout feel incomplete. I replaced them with properly sized placeholders for testing, switching back later.

3. *Form Validation*: I faced challenges with form validation, realizing it needed feedback for users. I researched JavaScript validation to implement real-time checks in the future.
